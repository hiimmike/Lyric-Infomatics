Thats how it starts
We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out
And if its crowded, all the better
Because we know were gonna be up late
But if youre worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
Thats how it starts
And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways we show our age
And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
And I still dont wanna stagger home
Then its the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
Oh, youre talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but its better when we pretend
It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except in parts
When the moral kicks in
Though when were running out of the drugs
And the conversations winding away
I wouldnt trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life
Oh, you drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
When youre blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired only where are your friends tonight?
And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night
And if I made a fool, if I made a fool
If I made a fool on the road, theres always this
And if Im sewn into submission
I can still come home to this
And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When youre drunk and the kids leave impossible tasks
You think over and over, hey, Im finally dead
Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You look contorted on yourself your ridiculous prop
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you always knew you were tired, but then
Where are your friends tonight
Where are your friends tonight
Where are your friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
